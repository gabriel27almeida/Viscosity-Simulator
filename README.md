# Viscosity-Simulator

The goal of this project is to simulate and animate small spheres falling through a viscous fluid. You will find two files:

- Experiment.py, where class `Experiment` is implemented 
- run.py, which runs the experiment

In the experiment, you can choose the radii of the spheres and the height of two auxiliary markers.
